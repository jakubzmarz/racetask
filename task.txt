1. Please create a java class RacePrice that will hold:
a. base price for a race
b. list of taxes prices
Prices are non-negative numbers representing money (please skip the currency information, it is irrelevant here).
2.    Total price for RacePrice is sum of base price and taxes prices.
3.    An Gaming company would like to introduce a special offer for their customers. It will define a total price limit at which it will offer races.

Your task is to implement a function which will convert RacePrice to meet the Gaming company total price limit.
4.    Given the RacePrice object and the total price limit value,
     modify all prices in RacePrice object proportionally (as much as possible),
     so that the sum of base and taxes is equal to total price limit defined by the Gaming company.
5.    It's critical that the total price for RacePrice is exactly equal to the total price limit.
6.    Please create unit tests.
7.    In case of undefined requirements please make reasonable assumptions.

Example 1:
Base = 10
Tax = 5
Tax = 5
total price limit = 10
Result:
Base = 5
Tax - 2.5
Tax - 2.5
____________________________
Example 2:
Base = 9
Tax = 1
Tax = 1
Tax = 1
total price limit = 6
Result:
Base = 4.5
Tax = 0.5
Tax = 0.5
Tax = 0.5
